//! Module implementing a base set of oscillator types for use in audio chains.
//!
//! Use [`RuntimeOscillator`] on devices where you have low memory constraints
//! and calculating the waveform samples on the fly at runtime is an acceptable
//! tradeoff.
//!
//! Use [`LookupOscillator`] with an oscillator pool on devices where you have
//! lots of available memory for oscillator lookup tables. Using an appropriate
//! oscillator pool allocator means the lookup tables can be shared across
//! oscillators of the same parameters to avoid memory duplication.
