# Board Support Packages

The Board Support Packages (BSP) crate provides preconfigured hardware abstractions and periperal drivers for modules and boards included in the ecosystem. 

Individual board packages are enabled using crate feature flags:
  * Board support for the Mini module.
    * `mini-v0_2` - Board support for the Mini v0.2 module.
