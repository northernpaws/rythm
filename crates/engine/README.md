# `rythm-engine`

The engine crate is the core of the entire ecosystem that provides the audio processing framework, transport and sequencing logic, and instrument system that create the composable Rythm framework. 

## Modules

 * `theory` - Music theory concepts as concrete types, such as enums for common octaves and pitches.
 * `audio` - Audio processing, DSP, and effects pipeline.
 * `instrument` - The playable instrument system.
 * `sequence` - Elektron-style step sequencing framework.

## Generics

Parts of the engine that rely on known compile-time constants for maximum allocation values, maximum slice sizes, etc. are heavily paramatarized with generics. This allows devices with different requirements, such as a synth that supports 4 voice polyphony vs a seqeuncer that supports 8, to be implemented with the same framework without needing a large array of custom types or trait implementations on the user's end.

## TODO

  * Add a proc_macro function for generating an oscillator lookup table statically at compile time.
